Index:245 PMID:25315684, Title: Repression of rRNA transcription by PARIS contributes to Parkinson's disease.
Sentence:
	1. We previously demonstrated that PARIS (PARkin Interacting Substrate, ZNF746) transcriptionally suppresses peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) in PD and its accumulation results in selective dopaminergic neuronal death.
	2. However, functional knowledge of PARIS is limited, and no other studies have been performed to elucidate its function.
	3. Here, we used tandem-affinity purification to identify the binding partners of PARIS, showing that PARIS interacts with 160-kDa Myb-binding protein 1alpha (MYBBP1A), which suppresses rRNA transcription and the rRNA editing process.
	4. Interestingly, PARIS was also found to interact with the components of RNA polymerase I, occupied the promoter of rDNA, and suppressed rDNA transcription in vivo.
	5. Accordingly, we observed a reduction of rRNA levels and increased expression of p53, a molecular marker of nucleolar stress, in the substantia nigra of conditional parkin knockout mice, AAV-mediated PARIS overexpression mice, and in patients with sporadic PD.
	6. Together, our results suggest that dysfunction of the Parkin-PARIS pathway may play a deleterious role in rRNA transcription and contribute to PD pathogenesis.

Sentence:
	1. The structural properties of an inherited fibrinogen abnormality designated fibrinogen Paris I were investigated.
	2. Dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of unreduced samples revealed no discernible differences in molecular weight from normal; this implied that in fibrinogen Paris I, the normal fibrinogen architecture of six covalently linked chains per molecule is preserved.
	3. A mutant chain (mol wt 52,500, termed gammaParis I) which replaces a large proportion of gamma-chains (mol wt 49,400) was shown, like normal gamma-chains, to lack thrombin- and Reptilase-sensitive sites.
	4. The gamma-chains and alpha-chains of Paris I fibrin underwent Factor XIIIa-catalyzed cross-linking slowly; this behavior was not attributable to an intrinsic abnormality of these chains themselves but rather to the inhibitory effect of the mutant gammaParis I chains on this process.
	5. Results of DEAE-cellulose gradient elution chromatography of Paris I fibrinogen preparations revealed the presence of small amounts of normal fibrinogen molecules and also indicated that the gammaParis I chains possessed structural overlap with gamma-chains.
	6. Unlike gamma-chains however, the gammaParis I chains did not incorporate dansylcadaverine in the prescence of Factor XIIIa, nor, as previously reported, did they undergo cross-linking.
	7. The observations indicate that the amine acceptor site found in the COOH-terminal region of the gamma-chain is either not present on the gammaParis I chain or is unavailable for cross-linking.
	8. Further support for localization of the abnormality in the COOH-terminal region of the molecule was obtained from the observation that during plasmic hydrolysis of Paris I fibrinogen, at least one unique form of core Fragment D (DParis I) was evolved, whereas Fragment E did not differ from normal.

Index:765 PMID:978044, Title: Plasmic degradation of fibrinogen Paris I.
Sentence:
	1. Fibrin obtained from the plasma of a patient having abnormal fibrogen Paris I contains normal alpha, beta, and gamma polypeptide chains as well as an abnormal gamma-chain (gammaParis I) of approximately 51,000 daltons molecular weight.
	2. Plasmic digestion of Paris I fibrogen and noncrosslinked fibrin yields both normal and abnormal Fragment D molecules, the latter having a higher negative charge and molecular weight than that liberated from normal fibrinogen and noncorsslinked fibrin.
	3. After disulfide bond reduction, an abnormal polypeptide chain of approximately 40,500 +/- 2,000 daltons molecular weight was demonstrated in the Paris I digests by dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
	4. Comparison with the electrophoretic pattern for reduced digests of normal substrates indicates that it is a gamma-chain remnant in the normal Fragment D.
	5. Although the carbohydrate content in the gamma-Paris I-chain is slightly higher than that in the normal gamma-chain, as measured by periodic acid-Schiff reagent (PAS) staining intensity, it is concluded that extra carbohydrate does not account for the high molecular weight of the gamma-Paris I-chain since the 40,500 dalton chain does not stain with PAS.
	6. Plasma digestion of Paris I crosslinked fibrin yields a large amount of Fragment D in addition to Fragment D-D ("D-dimer") and E molecules, in contrast to a digest of normal crosslinked fibrin, from which only the latter two fragments are formed.
	7. This finding suggests that the defect in fibrinogen Paris I derives from an abnormality in the carboxy-terminal region of the gammaParis I-chain, so that in the presence of Factor XIII, these chains are not crosslinked and Fragment D-D molecules are not liberated upon subsequent plasmic degradation.
	8. The data provide support for the previous conclusion that a longer than normal polypeptide chain sequence at the carboxy-terminal portion of the gammaParis I-chains accounts for the increased size of these chains relative to the normal gamma-chains and for the abnormal function of the intact fibrinogen Paris I molecule.

Index:1454 PMID:3607287, Title: ADP-induced platelet aggregation depends on the conformation or availability of the terminal gamma chain sequence of fibrinogen. Study of the reactivity of fibrinogen Paris 1.
Sentence:
	1. Fibrinogen Paris I contains a mutant gamma chain that is longer than the normal chain, resulting in altered fibrin polymerization and cross-linking.
	2. Because these functions involve the carboxy-terminal region of the gamma chain, we decided to determine whether fibrinogen Paris I or the isolated Paris I gamma chain supports normal ADP-induced platelet aggregation, a function that requires the ultimate 12 residues of the normal gamma chain (400 through 411).
	3. Aggregation of ADP-stimulated normal platelets was defective with fibrinogen Paris I and markedly depressed with the gamma Paris I chain.
	4. These findings prompted us to characterize the carboxy-terminal structure of the region of the gamma Paris I chain responsible for this activity.
	5. The carboxy-terminal cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptide of the normal gamma chain (385 through 411) or that from gamma Paris I was isolated by differential adsorption to triethylene-tetramine resin or by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
	6. The CNBr peptide from the Paris I gamma chain was identical to that of the normal gamma chain in its retention time on HPLC, its amino acid composition, and its sequence.
	7. Thus, the primary structure of the gamma Paris I chain from residue 384 through 411 is normal, indicating that a peptide insertion has occurred upstream from residue 384, resulting in an impairment of those physiologic functions attributable to the carboxy-terminal end of the gamma chain from position 384 (ie, cross-linking, ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and at least a portion of the gamma chain polymerization site).

Index:2183 PMID:8470043, Title: Paris I dysfibrinogenemia: a point mutation in intron 8 results in insertion of a 15 amino acid sequence in the fibrinogen gamma-chain.
Sentence:
	1. Paris I dysfibrinogenemia results in the production of a fibrinogen molecule containing a functionally abnormal gamma-chain.
	2. We determined the basis of the molecular defect using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the gamma-chain region of the Paris I subject's genomic DNA.
	3. Comparative sequence analysis of cloned PCR segments of normal and Paris I genomic DNA revealed only an A--&gt;G point mutation occurring at nucleotide position 6588 within intron 8 of the Paris I gamma-chain gene.
	4. This nucleotide change leads to a 45 bp fragment being inserted between exons 8 and 9 in the mature gamma Paris I chain mRNA, and encodes a 15 amino acid insert after gamma 350 [M-C-G-E-A-L-P-M-L-K-D-P-C-Y].
	5. Alternative splicing of this region from intron 8 into the mature Paris I gamma-chain mRNA also results after translation into a substitution of S for G at position gamma 351.
	6. Biochemical studies of 14C-iodoacetamide incorporation into disulfide-reduced Paris I and normal fibrinogen corroborated the molecular biologic predictions that two additional cysteine residues exist within the gamma Paris I chain.
	7. We conclude that the insertion of this amino acid sequence leads to a conformationally-altered, and dysfunctional gamma-chain in Paris I fibrinogen.
