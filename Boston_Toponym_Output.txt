Index:1210 PMID:64478, Title: A comparison of visual pathways in Boston and Midwestern Siamese cats.
Sentence:
	1. Previous investigations have shown that in the visual cortex this extra representation of ipsilateral visual field can be organized into one pattern in Boston Siamese cats, another in Midwestern.
	2. On the basis of microelectrode recordings from the visual cortex, 11 out of the 12 Siamese cats included here were Boston cats; one was Midwestern.
	3. Overall, the LGN organization in Boston cats was similar to that of Midwestern: both lateral and medial normal segments of lamina A1 (mnA1) were present.
	4. In Boston cats, however, the mnA1 was remarkably small and shifted ventromedially in the nucleus to allow for the fusion between the medial borders of lamina A and the abnormal segment of A1.
	5. These differences in organization of the LGN are consistent with those seen at the level of the visual cortex in Midwestern and Boston Siamese cats.

Index:1211 PMID:833349, Title: Abnormal interhemispheric connections in the visual system of Boston Siamese cats: a physiological study.
Sentence:
	1. Due to a genetic mutation in Boston Siamese cats, the anatomical 17-18 border now represents a region in the ipsilateral visual field roughly 20 degrees away from the vertical meridian, and the representation of the vertical midline is displaced from the border to regions within areas 17 and 18 proper.
	2. Do visual fibers in the Boston Siamese cat corpus callosum originate, as in normal cats, from the 17-18 border even though the vertical meridian is no longer represented there? The present paper deals with this question from a physiological standpoint.
	3. Single visual fibers in the corpus callosum of 11 Boston Siamese and two normal cats were recorded using extracellular microelectrodes.
	4. In Boston Siamese cats, however, an abnormally large amount of visual field was represented in the corpus callosum, with some receptive fields located as far as 25 degrees away from the vertical meridian.
	5. The present findings suggest, therefore, that in Boston Siamese cats callosal fibers do not originate solely from the boundary regions between adjacent cortical areas, such as the anatomical 17-18 border, but originate also from other cortical regions, especially the vertical meridian representation, regardless of their location with respect to such boundaries.
